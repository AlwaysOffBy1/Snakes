Based off of this video https://youtu.be/Gx5D09s5X6U?t=46

Download snakes.xlsm, enable the macro, and select "Start" to watch the simulation! 

Check off "Animate" if you'd like to watch the snake get generated segment by segment, and "Use Colors" to organize each segment by color as it's generated.

For fastest results uncheck both options.
