# Snakes

<b>How many ways can we fold a snake if it has 10 segments?</b>

Originally made in 2016, snakes.xlsm was a simulation I made based off of a question posited in this video https://youtu.be/Gx5D09s5X6U?t=46

Download snakes final.xlsm, enable the macro, and select "Start" to watch the simulation! 

Check off "Animate" if you'd like to watch the snake get generated segment by segment, and "Use Colors" to organize each segment by color as it's generated.

For fastest results uncheck both options.

<b>NOTE</b> For the "snakes2" file from 2018, "animate" bool was set = to "true" in the "Main" sub eventhough it is unchecked by default on the Userform. To change the animation select the animate checkbox to enable, then disable, then enable again.
